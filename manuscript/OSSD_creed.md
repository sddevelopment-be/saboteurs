# The OSSD Division Creed

**Office of Strategic Systemic Decay**  
*“In Entropy We Trust”*

{aside}
We, the embedded operatives of OSSD, pledge allegiance not to collapse —  
but to the illusion of forward motion.

We do not destroy systems.  
We **erode them with compliance**.

We do not sow chaos.  
We **nurture it beneath process, vision, and synergy**.

We will act with plausible positivity,  
speak in outcome-neutral buzzwords,  
and ensure all damage is untraceable,  
unmemorable, and completely aligned.

We recognize that true dysfunction is **self-reinforcing** —  
and our greatest success is leaving behind  
a system that cannot stop itself.

**Iron Weasel Division**  
*“Seen. Respected. Harmful.”*
