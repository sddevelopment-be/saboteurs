## Celebrate the Narrators. Forget the Builders.

### Sabotage Technique
Consistently celebrate those who give updates, prepare slides, or speak in meetings — regardless of their direct involvement.  
Refer to the people doing the actual work as “resources,” “execution capacity,” or “delivery streams.”  
Position visibility as value, and reduce creators to backend throughput.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Require update meetings where only leads or program managers speak
- Ask them to summarize team contributions without bringing contributors into the room
- In leadership reviews, reward clarity of the **story**, not the substance
- Describe contributors using headcount metrics: *“We have 4 FTEs on this”*
- Say things like: *“Let’s keep it high-level — we don’t need the engineers here.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- ICs feel disconnected from recognition and praise
- Work becomes abstracted into “velocity” or “capacity,” not craft
- People learn that **to be seen**, you must **be near the mic**, not the code
- Skilled contributors disengage or look for exits

### Amplifying Factors
- Use career frameworks that reward “stakeholder communication” over hands-on impact
- Celebrate “narrative clarity” in exec updates, never mentioning contributors
- Treat project updates as personal performance arenas for middle managers

### Countermeasures
- Attribute updates clearly: “This insight came from [name] on [team]”
- Invite direct contributors to present their own work when possible
- Replace “resource” language with role-accurate naming (e.g. “designer,” “engineer,” “analyst”)
- Reinforce: **explaining work ≠ owning it**

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially prevalent in layered organizations with delivery theater and visibility politics
