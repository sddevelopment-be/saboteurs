## Ownership by Inbox

### Sabotage Technique
Send vague direction emails with highly detailed background info and no clear recipient. Use **“you”** to refer to multiple people.  
Include mixed audiences with different roles.  
End with: *“I expect you to take ownership of this.”*

### Field Deployment Instructions
- Draft walls of context with no call to action
- Use passive voice: *“It needs to be done”*, *“Someone should pick this up”*
- Refer to earlier vague conversations as precedent
- Make ownership implicit, then escalate when no one replies
- Praise those who self-assign -- then assign blame if they get it wrong

### Expected Symptoms
- Long silences, then sudden firefighting
- Quiet confusion about whether a task was ever assigned
- “I thought you meant me?” retrospectives
- Task pickup by the most conscientious, regardless of role fit

### Amplifying Factors
- CC more senior people to increase pressure
- Use vague project names or acronyms
- Praise people who “just take initiative” without checking context
- Escalate lack of ownership in performance reviews

### Countermeasures
- Use role-targeted tags (e.g., `[ACTION: DEV]`, `[DECISION: ARCH]`)
- Require named ownership and deadlines in delegation
- Encourage clarifying replies without penalty
- Reiterate team working agreements on communication expectations

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` -- Especially common in medium to large 'flat' orgs, fast-paced teams, or politeness-heavy cultures.
