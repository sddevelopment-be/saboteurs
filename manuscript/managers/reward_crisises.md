## Reward Crisis, Ignore Prevention

### Sabotage Technique
Celebrate visible heroics during high-stakes recoveries.  
Ignore those who designed systems that quietly worked.  
Treat firefighting as passion. Treat prevention as passivity.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Praise responders with urgency: *“They saved the day!”*
- Never retroactively credit those who warned, planned, or stabilized
- Say: *“Let’s spotlight our incident response team”* — but not those who reduced incident volume
- Let prevention work disappear into “business as usual”

### Expected Symptoms
- Quiet resentment from proactive staff
- Overwork cycles driven by repeatable failures
- Rising system fragility, normalized as “just how things go”
- Performance inflated by reactivity, not resilience

### Amplifying Factors
- Track “incident response time” but not “incident avoidance”
- Frame reliability engineers as “not in the front lines”
- Promote from fire drills, not system design

### Countermeasures
- Celebrate **unseen stability**
- Make postmortems include: *“What prevented this?”*
- Reward boring systems and non-events

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in fast-paced cultures addicted to adrenaline
