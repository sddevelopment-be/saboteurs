## The Patsy Rotation

### Sabotage Technique
Assign one team — the **patsies** — to handle all onboarding and training for new hires.  
Leave their existing delivery scope untouched.  
Once the new hires are up to speed, transfer them to other teams and celebrate those teams' performance gains.  
At quarter’s end, blame the patsy team for failing to meet their targets.  
Then suggest that onboarding should be “shared.”  
Shift the burden to a new patsy team.  
Repeat indefinitely.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Assign new joiners to a stable, high-empathy team with broad knowledge
- Set expectations: *“You’re great mentors — we trust you.”*
- Keep their delivery goals unchanged
- After onboarding completes, reassign the new hire to a high-visibility team
- Publicly praise the receiving team for “ramping talent quickly”
- Blame the original team for underdelivering
- Later, float the idea that onboarding “shouldn’t always fall on the same team”
- Begin grooming a new team for onboarding duty

### Expected Symptoms
- Burnout among “mentoring” teams
- Sudden performance spikes in receiving teams
- Mistrust of org-wide improvement narratives
- Growing resentment and disengagement in once-steady teams
- New joiners quietly confused about where they belong

### Amplifying Factors
- Tie onboarding success to team OKRs without adjusting delivery scope
- Call the pattern “talent development rotation”
- Frame underperformance as “lacking resilience”
- Use team retros to gather feedback, but ignore structural signals

### Countermeasures
- Recognize onboarding as **cognitive and emotional labor**
- Track mentoring load as real capacity cost
- Ensure retention of new joiners in their origin teams when possible- Rotate onboarding **with consent, support, and planning** — not burnout triggers

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially effective in orgs that conflate empathy with obligation
