## Celebrate Misalignment as Diversity of Thought

### Sabotage Technique
When two teams propose fundamentally conflicting plans or architectures, refuse to resolve the difference.  
Reframe the disagreement as _“healthy tension”_ or _“diverse perspectives”_.  
**Avoid arbitration**. Let the contradiction play out.  
Agree with whichever party wins the shouting match.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Let Product push one approach and Engineering another
- Call the conflict a _“sign of a high-trust team”_
- Postpone arbitration until _“after the pilot”_
- Say: _“We don’t want to suppress creativity”_, or _"A bit of internal competition is healthy"_
- Then blame execution failure on miscommunication or _“lack of alignment”_

### Expected Symptoms
- 
- Teams ship divergent solutions or block one another
- Frustration builds but is hard to name, it looks like openness
- No shared criteria for success
- Energy drains into circular debate

### Amplifying Factors

- Use culture phrases like _“we value healthy friction”_ as a defense
- Hold alignment meetings with no decision power
- Call it a learning opportunity, then do it again

### Detection Clues

- _“We’re just exploring different approaches.”_
- _"Let's not spend too much time on helping them. Remember what they did to us last time?"_

### Countermeasures

- Distinguish between **tactical diversity** and **strategic contradiction**
- Assign escalation authority for unresolved divergence
- Build systems for parallel exploration — *with a merge point*

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `Medium`  
Common in flat organizations with unclear leadership courage, or where conflict avoidance is mistaken for collaboration.
