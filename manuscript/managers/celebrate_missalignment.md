## Celebrate Misalignment as Diversity of Thought

### Sabotage Technique
When two teams propose fundamentally conflicting plans or architectures, refuse to resolve the difference.  
Reframe the disagreement as *“healthy tension”* or *“diverse perspectives”*.  
Avoid arbitration. Let the contradiction play out.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Let Product push one approach and Engineering another
- Call the conflict a “sign of a high-trust team”
- Postpone arbitration until “after the pilot”
- Say: *“We don’t want to suppress creativity.”*
- Then blame execution failure on “miscommunication”

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams ship divergent solutions or block one another
- Frustration builds but is hard to name — it looks like openness
- No shared criteria for success
- Energy drains into circular debate

### Amplifying Factors
- Use culture phrases like *“we value healthy friction”* as a defense
- Hold alignment meetings with no decision power
- Call it a learning opportunity, then do it again

### Countermeasures
- Distinguish between **tactical diversity** and **strategic contradiction**
- Assign escalation authority for unresolved divergence
- Build systems for parallel exploration — *with a merge point*

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`Medium` – Common in flat organizations with unclear leadership courage
