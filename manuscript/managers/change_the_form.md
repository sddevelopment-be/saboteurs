## Change the Form, Not the Process

### Sabotage Technique
Avoid improving the actual process.  
Instead, change the documentation template.  
Redesign planning formats, update slide decks, and tweak reporting fields every few weeks.  
Make teams spend their time **updating formats instead of improving substance**.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Create a new _“standardized”_ reporting format with fresh terminology
- Mandate a full migration of existing plans or OKRs into the new layout
- Require rephrasing of current work into new categories or headings
- Call this _“alignment”_ or _“streamlining”_
- Schedule new meetings to explain the updated template

### Expected Symptoms

- Lost hours to document translation with no change in delivery
- Rising frustration over constant format churn
- Real issues hidden under terminology rewrites
- Work becomes _“presentation-compatible”_ instead of delivery-focused

### Amplifying Factors

- Call it _“continuous improvement”_
- Highlight cosmetic consistency as a win
- Penalize teams who continue using older templates for clarity

### Detection Clues

- _“We spent a week updating our OKRs to fit the new template.”_
- _“The new format is more streamlined, but I’m not sure what’s changed.”_
- _"Do we really need to rework all our plans just to match the new headings?"_

### Countermeasures
- 
- Evaluate processes based on **value created**, not format compliance
- Keep templates stable and purpose-fit
- Allow teams to adapt formats locally if functionally equivalent
- Ask: _“What behavior does this template change actually support?”_

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `Medium`  
Looks harmless, but slowly replaces effectiveness with admin churn.
