## Change the Form, Not the Process

### Sabotage Technique
Avoid improving the actual process.  
Instead, change the documentation template.  
Redesign planning formats, update slide decks, and tweak reporting fields every few weeks.  
Make teams spend their time updating formats instead of improving substance.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Create a new “standardized” reporting format with fresh terminology
- Mandate a full migration of existing plans or OKRs into the new layout
- Require rephrasing of current work into new categories or headings
- Call this “alignment” or “streamlining”
- Schedule new meetings to explain the updated template

### Expected Symptoms
- Lost hours to document translation with no change in delivery
- Rising frustration over constant format churn
- Real issues hidden under terminology rewrites
- Work becomes “presentation-compatible” instead of delivery-focused

### Amplifying Factors
- Call it “continuous improvement”
- Highlight cosmetic consistency as a win
- Penalize teams who continue using older templates for clarity

### Countermeasures
- Evaluate processes based on **value created**, not format compliance
- Keep templates stable and purpose-fit
- Allow teams to adapt formats locally if functionally equivalent
- Ask: *“What behavior does this template change actually support?”*

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`Medium` – Looks harmless, but slowly replaces effectiveness with admin churn
