## Track It All. Then Ask for Email.

### Sabotage Technique
Require teams to maintain multiple disconnected tracking systems — detailed and high-level, always manually aligned.  
Enforce strict reporting hygiene.  
Then, **routinely bypass those systems** by asking for real-time updates via Slack, email, or impromptu face-to-face conversations.  
Make it clear that **what matters is what you personally hear** — not what’s in the tools.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Demand weekly tracker updates across systems A and B
- Enforce format rules, tags, cross-references, and templates
- Then drop into Slack: *“Hey, quick — where are we on that item?”*
- Ask for summaries in email threads, even if the tracker is up to date
- During meetings, ignore the tooling and ask for verbal updates
- Praise responsiveness over system completeness

### Expected Symptoms
- Double and triple-entry maintenance
- Rising distrust in tooling as “fake work”
- Contributors quietly stop updating systems unless chased
- Leaders claim “no visibility” despite well-maintained trackers

### Amplifying Factors
- Provide no consistent channel preference — jump between Slack, email, meetings, and tracking systems at will
- Ask for “quick decks” that duplicate tracker content, rephrased for your consumption
- Penalize delays in face-to-face responses, even when systems are current
- Reference out-of-date information because you “didn’t check the tool”

### Detection Clues
- “It’s in the tracker — did you not see it?”
- “Can you summarize it again in email just for me?”
- “I didn’t have time to look — just walk me through it quickly.”
- “Let’s not rely on tools — we’re human here.”

### Countermeasures
- Treat systems of record as **first-class communication channels**
- Refuse informal updates for system-tracked work unless paired with a follow-up update
- Use shared dashboards or async status pulses, not ad-hoc pull requests
- Help leadership understand that **looping out the system breaks the system**

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in exec-heavy orgs where “being looped in” outweighs organizational coherence
