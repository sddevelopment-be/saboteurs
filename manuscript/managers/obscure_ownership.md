## Obscure Ownership with Vague Role Labels

### Sabotage Technique
Ensure no one knows who owns what — but pretend accountability is defined.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
Use a RACI matrix filled with ambiguous terms like “reviewer,” “approver,” and “contributor.”  
Avoid naming real people. Reference “the team” often. Never define escalation paths.

### Expected Symptoms
- Endless cycles of alignment with no decisions
- Blame diffusion
- Accountability theater during delivery crunch

### Amplifying Factors
- Introduce more matrix roles with overlapping scopes
- Use org charts instead of actual delivery paths

### Detection Clues
- “I assumed [X] was handling that.”
- “That’s not really my area, but I can take a look...”
- “Let’s bring it up in the next sync.”

### Countermeasures
- Use plain-language accountability: *“You own this. Talk to [X] if blocked.”*
- Make unclear ownership a first-class architectural concern
- Validate actual resolution paths during project scoping

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High` – This pattern is active in most orgs without anyone naming it
