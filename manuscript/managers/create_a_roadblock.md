## Create a Bottleneck, Then Obstruct It

### Sabotage Technique

Centralize all critical knowledge and decision-making in one reliable person.  
Then, reward them with a “special assignment” that pulls them away at the worst possible time.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Let one person quietly accumulate domain knowledge, decision rights, and glue work.
- Avoid pairing or documentation. Reward _“stepping up.”_
- When things get messy, assign them to an org-wide initiative, tiger team, or cross-pillar working group.
- Say things like: _“You’re the only one who can handle this”_, or _“We need your insight on this strategic project.”_
- When they’re pulled away, let the team struggle to fill the gap.
- If they ask for help, say: _“We’ll wait for [bottleneck name] to return”_, or _“Let’s not disturb them, they’re busy”_.

### Expected Symptoms

- Delivery stalls as teams _“check with [bottleneck name]”_
- Passive delays disguised as carefulness
- Rising anxiety and defensive behavior from teammates

### Amplifying Factors

- Combine this with siloed Jira ownership or role-locked access rights
- Remove the bottleneck without notice
- Have them stay “available for questions” but book them 100% elsewhere

### Detection Clues

- _“We’re waiting on [X] to clarify.”_
- _“Can we just get 15 minutes of their time?”_
- _“We didn’t touch that part. [X] always handled it.”_

### Countermeasures

- Treat concentration of context as a **structural risk**, not a badge of honor
- Rotate responsibilities proactively
- Introduce **cross-training** and **pairing** as standard practice
- Build team scaffolds: shared docs, shadow ownership, and pattern repositories
- When reassigning someone, plan a proper **handover arc** -- not a sudden extraction

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
Common in orgs that reward firefighting and forget to design for resilience
