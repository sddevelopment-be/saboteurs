## Create a Bottleneck, Then Obstruct It

### Sabotage Technique
Centralize all critical knowledge and decision-making in one reliable person.  
Then, reward them with a “special assignment” that pulls them away at the worst possible time.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Let one person quietly accumulate domain knowledge, decision rights, and glue work.
- Avoid pairing or documentation. Reward “stepping up.”
- When things get messy, assign them to an org-wide initiative, tiger team, or cross-pillar working group.
- Say things like: “You’re the only one who can handle this.”

### Expected Symptoms
- Delivery stalls as teams “check with [bottleneck name]”
- Passive delays disguised as carefulness
- Rising anxiety and defensive behavior from teammates

### Amplifying Factors
- Combine this with siloed Jira ownership or role-locked access rights
- Remove the bottleneck without notice
- Have them stay “available for questions” but book them 100% elsewhere

## Detection Clues
- “We’re waiting on [X] to clarify.”
- “Can we just get 15 minutes of their time?”
- “We didn’t touch that part — they always handled it.”

### Countermeasures
- Treat concentration of context as a **structural risk**, not a badge of honor
- Rotate responsibilities proactively
- Build team scaffolds: shared docs, shadow ownership, and pattern repositories
- When reassigning someone, plan a proper **handover arc** — not a sudden extraction

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Common in orgs that reward firefighting and forget to design for resilience
