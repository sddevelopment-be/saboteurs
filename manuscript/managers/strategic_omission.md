## Strategic Omission

### Sabotage Technique
Exclude a key contributor from an important email thread or chat discussion.  
Let the conversation evolve over days or weeks.  
Then ask the omitted person for an urgent update -- citing the missing thread as context.

When they express confusion, promise to forward the chain.  
Wait **at least 48 hours**. Bonus points if the forward arrives just before a deadline or when the relevant parties are unavailable.

### Field Deployment Instructions
- Pretend their exclusion was accidental: *“Oh! I assumed you were on it.”*
- Reference older threads with buried context: *“As discussed below...”*
- Ask for status updates tied to undocumented decisions
- Express disappointment if they’re not __“up to speed”__
- Avoid Slack or live clarification; keep everything vague and async

### Expected Symptoms
- Diminished trust from the excluded party
- Panic work or disengagement
- Passive resentment or overcompensation
- Shadow policies created through parallel channels

### Amplifying Factors
- Involve senior stakeholders in the original thread
- Set follow-up deadlines during holiday weeks
- Use internal acronyms or shorthand they haven’t seen
- Publicly ask why they weren’t prepared

### Countermeasures
- Default to shared docs or visible workspaces
- Normalize reply threads with *“+adding [Name] who owns this”*
- Encourage teammates to verify context when confused
- Make ownership handoffs explicit, not passive

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`Very High` -- Especially in remote teams, async cultures, or deadline-driven orgs
