## Simulate Cultural Change. Then Install an Air Hockey Table.

### Sabotage Technique
Recruit a group of highly motivated, respected employees into a “culture improvement initiative.”  
Instruct them to collect widespread feedback with full organizational participation.  
Make a big public deal about how important and serious this is.  
Then… derail everything behind a fog of process, visibility, and false hope.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Create a cross-functional _“Process Improvement Task Force”_
- Mandate full cooperation from all departments: _“This is your moment to shape our future.”_
- Require all feedback to be submitted through a confusing or tedious form
- Have the task force present _“aggregated insights”_ using vague, jargon-heavy language
- Hold multiple feedback meetings, heavily branded and scheduled across weeks
- Announce a leadership offsite to review findings — **make it luxurious, well-photographed, and joyfully advertised**
- After the offsite, send a generic email saying: _“We heard you, and we’re committed to change!”_ 
- Host an all-hands meeting to unveil the _“new culture initiative”_ and praise management for their dedication and hard work.
- Organize a mandatory _“team-building”_ event with pizza, beer, and announce the installation of **air hockey tables** in the break room as the first _“tangible outcome”_ of the initiative.
- Never follow up on any of the actual feedback or suggestions. If pressed, say: _“We’re still working on it. Stay tuned!”_

### Expected Symptoms
- Emotional investment from teams, followed by deep fatigue
- Staff start to question whether change is ever real
- Cynicism spreads: _“Why bother speaking up?”_
- Task force members feel manipulated, then burned out
- _“Engagement”_ becomes a dirty word

### Amplifying Factors
- Thank only **management** publicly for their engagement and dedication
- Provide no actual synthesis or published decision record
- Delay follow-up for 6–8 weeks, then announce… a new **employee lounge**
- Host an _“off-the-clock”_ event with pizza and unveil air hockey tables as the tangible outcome

## Detection Clues
- _“They made us fill out a survey, but nothing came of it.”_
- _“We gave them dozens of real ideas. They added bean bags.”_
- _“This place doesn’t want change — they want applause.”_
- _“They’re proud of listening, not acting.”_

### Countermeasures
- Never launch an improvement initiative without **commitment to implement** at least one uncomfortable change
- Make visible which ideas were **accepted, rejected, or deferred — and why**
- Include frontline voices in decision review, not just collection
- Avoid performative fixes — or **explicitly name them as interim gestures**, not “transformation”

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – This pattern doesn't just fail to improve the culture; it **inoculates people against ever trying again**
