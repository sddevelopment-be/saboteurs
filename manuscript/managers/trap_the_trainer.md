## Trap the Trainer

### Sabotage Technique
Identify the most reliable, experienced team member and assign them to train every new hire.  
Let those new hires rotate out to new opportunities.  
Meanwhile, **deny or indefinitely defer** any change-of-role or growth request from the trainer.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Frame the trainer role as _“critical for onboarding success”_
- Provide no clear exit plan, succession plan, or growth path
- When the trainer expresses interest in switching roles or advancing, respond with:
    - _“We just need you to stay a little longer.”_
    - _“You’re too valuable in your current spot.”_
- Reassign new joiners to exciting roles once trained
- Keep the trainer in place _“for team continuity”_

### Expected Symptoms
- The trainer becomes quietly resentful or checked-out
- New joiners flourish while the trainer stagnates
- Others learn that **reliability leads to being stuck**, while quiet disengagement gets you reassigned
- Career development signals become **inverted and demoralizing**

### Amplifying Factors
- Publicly praise the trainer’s _“dedication”_ while privately deprioritizing their career growth
- Use guilt: *“Think of the team — no one else can do this like you.”*
- Never document or acknowledge the effort required for onboarding
- Pretend retention of knowledge is _“just natural”_, not effortful

### Detection Clues
- _“I’ve trained five people this year and haven’t had a chance to move.”_
- _“They keep asking me to onboard folks, but I never get new opportunities.”_
- _“I was told I’m too important to be moved.”_
- _“They said next quarter… again.”_

### Countermeasures
- Set time-bound trainer rotations with defined handover windows
- Treat onboarding as a **team-wide responsibility**, not a personal sentence
- Recognize and reward onboarding as a **career builder**, not a blocker
- Track how often people in _“stability roles”_ are given forward options

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in teams with legacy experts, low turnover, or invisible glue work
