## Reorg the Org Chart, Not the Problems

### Sabotage Technique
Routinely reorganize teams, reporting lines, or leadership layers.  
Do not address any of the root causes of delivery friction, interpersonal mistrust, or unclear ownership.  
Present the reorg as a strategic reset — not as reactive confusion.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Reassign teams under new umbrellas with fresh acronyms
- Introduce “dotted-line relationships” to increase reporting ambiguity
- Say: *“This will break silos and increase alignment.”*
- Do not pause in-flight initiatives.
- Provide new swimlanes and RACI charts, but no behavioral guidance

### Expected Symptoms
- Planning cycles reset before outcomes can emerge
- Cross-team relationships dissolve and must be rebuilt
- Legacy responsibilities become orphaned
- New frictions emerge — then trigger the *next* reorg

### Amplifying Factors
- Do it annually, or after every major conflict
- Frame every reorg as “forward-looking,” regardless of context
- Replace team names and tool labels — but not decision boundaries

### Countermeasures
- Reorg only with **problem-first analysis**
- Preserve core relationships unless dysfunction is traced to structure
- Address incentive and authority design — not just boxes on a slide

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High` – Especially common in matrix orgs and transformation-happy leadership teams
