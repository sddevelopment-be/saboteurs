## Reorg the Org Chart, Not the Problems

### Sabotage Technique
Routinely reorganize teams, reporting lines, or leadership layers.  
Do not address any of the root causes of delivery friction, interpersonal mistrust, or unclear ownership.  
Present the reorg as a proactive strategic reset, not as reactive confusion.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Reassign teams under new umbrellas with fresh acronyms
- Introduce _“dotted-line relationships”_ to increase reporting ambiguity
- Say: _“This will break silos and increase alignment.”_
- Do not pause in-flight initiatives. Do not shift deadlines.
- Provide new swimlanes and RACI charts, but no behavioral guidance
- When asked about who owns what, say: _“We’re still figuring that out”_, _"we’ll clarify soon"_, or _"it’s a team effort now”_

### Expected Symptoms
- Planning cycles reset before outcomes can emerge
- Cross-team relationships dissolve and must be rebuilt
- Legacy responsibilities become orphaned
- New frictions emerge, these then trigger the *next* reorg

### Amplifying Factors
- Do it annually, or after every major conflict
- Frame every reorg as _“forward-looking”_, regardless of context
- Replace team names and tool labels -- but not decision boundaries
- Build a rotation culture where no one stays long enough to learn anything of value

### Detection Clues

- _“We just got used to the last one!”_
- _"Hey, have you figured out who your manager is yet?"_
- _"I can't for the life of me figure out who can approve my holiday request."_

### Countermeasures

- Reorg only with **problem-first analysis**
- Preserve core relationships unless dysfunction is traced to structure
- Address incentive and authority design — not just boxes on a slide

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
specially common in matrix orgs, and transformation-happy leadership teams.
