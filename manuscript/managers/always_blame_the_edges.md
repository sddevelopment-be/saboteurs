## Always Blame the Edges

### Sabotage Technique
When failures occur, blame _“edge cases”_, communication gaps, or interfaces between teams.  
Never review the core decision or process design.  
Act like the system was solid -- only the humans failed.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Say things like: _“It fell through the cracks”_ or _“The handoff was misunderstood”_.
- Avoid reviewing upstream constraints or systemic misalignment
- Blame teams for failing to self-organize across silos
- Refer to problems as _“coordination breakdowns”_, not design failures
- Never do anything to resolve the misalignment; just keep blaming the edges

### Expected Symptoms
- Repeat issues blamed on _“one-off”_ misalignments
- Growing turfiness between teams
- No improvement in cross-functional effectiveness
- Everyone is watching their borders instead of owning outcomes

### Amplifying Factors
- Layer in RACI charts without accountability follow-through
- Keep ownership maps vague
- Build incentives that reward silo performance over systemic success
- In post-mortems, focus on _“who should have caught it”_ instead of _“how can we prevent it”_

### Detection Clues

- _“We didn’t know that was part of our scope.”_
- _“We thought they were handling it, but they thought we were.”_
- _"Wait. Why are we responsible for that process all of a sudden?”_
- _"No one told us someone was supposed to follow-up on that.”_

### Countermeasures
- Analyze failures as **system behaviors**, not individual lapses
- Create boundary-spanning roles with **joint accountability**
- Use interface mapping as part of architectural retros

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `Very High`  
Particularly common in highly matrixed or over-specialized orgs, with limited cross-functional ownership.
