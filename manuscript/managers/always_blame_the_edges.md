## Always Blame the Edges

### Sabotage Technique
When failures occur, blame “edge cases,” communication gaps, or interfaces between teams.  
Never review the core decision or process design.  
Act like the system was solid — only the humans failed.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Say things like: *“It fell through the cracks”* or *“The handoff was misunderstood”*.
- Avoid reviewing upstream constraints or systemic misalignment
- Blame teams for failing to self-organize across silos
- Refer to problems as *“coordination breakdowns”*, not design failures

### Expected Symptoms
- Repeat issues blamed on “one-off” misalignments
- Growing turfiness between teams
- No improvement in cross-functional effectiveness
- Everyone is watching their borders instead of owning outcomes

### Amplifying Factors
- Layer in RACI charts without accountability follow-through
- Keep ownership maps vague
- Build incentives that reward silo performance over systemic success

### Countermeasures
- Analyze failures as **system behaviors**, not individual lapses
- Create boundary-spanning roles with **joint accountability**
- Use interface mapping as part of architectural retros

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Particularly common in highly matrixed or over-specialized orgs
