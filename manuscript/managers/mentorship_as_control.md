## Mentorship as Control or Contempt

### Sabotage Technique

Launch a formal mentorship program.  
Claim it will _“develop talent”_ and _“build future leaders”_.  

Then assign mentors based on two criteria only:

1. Their place in the org chart (i.e., direct managers)
2. Their unwillingness or unfitness for the role (e.g., burned-out cynics, dismissive seniors)

Frame it as a growth opportunity — for the mentee.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Announce the program with a flourish: *“We believe in unlocking everyone’s potential.”*
- Assign mentors without consultation or consent
- Avoid training or vetting — assume anyone senior is a good mentor
- Pair people with their own line manager or with well-known _“difficult personalities”_
- When it doesn’t work, blame the mentee for not leaning in

### Expected Symptoms

- Mentees feel policed, not supported
- Sessions are skipped, awkward, or quietly canceled
- Feedback becomes riskier, not safer
- Mentorship becomes synonymous with **damage control or judgment**

### Amplifying Factors

- Track mentorship hours but not effectiveness
- Celebrate program participation without qualitative feedback
- Assign mentors based on *“people with capacity”* rather than *“people with care”*
- Use 1:1s to _“check in on the mentorship”_ instead of actually fixing it, ensure any remedial effort is to be perfomed by the mentee.

### Countermeasures

- Separate mentorship from reporting lines
- Let mentees request or change mentors without stigma
- Define mentorship as a skill, not a title privilege
- Train mentors in listening, context, and non-transactional support

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High` – Especially common in orgs trying to fix culture without relinquishing control
