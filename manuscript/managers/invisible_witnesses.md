## Vague Warnings, Invisible Witnesses

### Sabotage Technique
Tell someone you've received “concerning feedback” about their attitude or professionalism.  
Be deliberately vague.  
Do not disclose who said it, what was said, or in what context.  
Frame it as a helpful heads-up — then offer no path to resolution.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Use passive constructions: _“It’s been noticed that…”_ or _“Some concerns have been raised…”_
- Emphasize tone or attitude rather than specific behavior
- Refuse to clarify context or give examples — say *“It’s not about any one thing”*
- Reassure the person that it’s _“not disciplinary”_ but _“something to reflect on”_
- Make future evaluations subtly contingent on behavioral improvement

### Expected Symptoms
- Anxiety, second-guessing, or social withdrawal
- Person begins avoiding meetings, asserting less, or over-apologizing
- Teammates may notice a shift without knowing why
- Creates shadow reputations with no mechanism for challenge or repair

### Amplifying Factors
- Deliver the warning just before a break, holiday, or evaluation period
- Mention that “others have noticed too” without naming anyone
- Avoid written records — make it impossible to follow up
- If the person asks for clarity, say *“I’m just the messenger”*

## Detection Clues
- “Apparently I’ve upset someone, but I don’t know who.”
- “I was told my attitude needs work, but not what that means.”
- “They said it’s not a big deal, but I feel like I’m being watched.”
- “I don’t know how to fix something I can’t see.”

### Countermeasures
- Refuse to deliver feedback that cannot be acted upon or traced to context
- Model feedback as **situated, observable behavior** with outcomes
- Build team norms that treat anonymous, vague feedback as **incomplete data**, not truth
- Encourage direct conversations, with support if needed — not hidden whispers

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Common in hierarchical, passive-aggressive, or _“niceness-over-honesty”_ cultures
