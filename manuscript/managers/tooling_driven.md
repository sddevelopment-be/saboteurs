## If It’s Not in the Tool, It Didn’t Happen

### Sabotage Technique
Ignore all verbal communication, real-world effort, or informal progress.  
Only acknowledge work that has been properly logged, labeled, and formatted in the official system (e.g. Jira, Asana, Monday).  
Use this data as the only _“source of truth”_ for evaluations and planning.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Declare: *“We need everything in the tool, for transparency.”*
- Dismiss untracked work as _“invisible”_ or _“not aligned”_
- Retroactively scold contributors for failing to log their hours, comments, or ticket updates
- Use incomplete tooling data to question people’s productivity
- Ban hallway syncs or quick Slack agreements — unless mirrored in the system

### Expected Symptoms
- People duplicate communication just to satisfy tooling
- Focus shifts from solving problems to documenting activity
- Collaboration slows due to _“ticket-first”_ policies
- Contributors learn to work **on the real issue and then fake the timeline**

### Amplifying Factors
- Track metrics like _“tickets closed”_, _"response rates"_, or _"traceable hours"_. Make these a proxy for success
- Automatically generate reports that ignore off-system activity
- Penalize teams that move fast without pristine audit trails

### Detection Clues

- _"Did you log that in the tool?"_
- _"I can’t find that in the tracker."_
- _“I thought we agreed on that in the meeting?”_
- _"I don't have a ticket for that. Please talk to my manager."_

### Countermeasures
- Use tools to **support visibility**, not define reality
- Encourage async updates, but value trusted conversations too
- Track **outcomes, not artifacts**
- Define “source of truth” as a shared narrative, not a checkbox log

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High`  
Especially common in _“data-driven”_ orgs without context-driven judgment.
