## If It’s Not in the Tool, It Didn’t Happen

### Sabotage Technique
Ignore all verbal communication, real-world effort, or informal progress.  
Only acknowledge work that has been properly logged, labeled, and formatted in the official system (e.g. Jira, Asana, Monday).  
Use this data as the only “source of truth” for evaluations and planning.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Declare: *“We need everything in the tool — for transparency.”*
- Dismiss untracked work as “invisible” or “not aligned.”
- Retroactively scold contributors for failing to log their hours, comments, or ticket updates
- Use incomplete tooling data to question people’s productivity
- Ban hallway syncs or quick Slack agreements — unless mirrored in the system

### Expected Symptoms
- People duplicate communication just to satisfy tooling
- Focus shifts from solving problems to documenting activity
- Collaboration slows due to “ticket-first” policies
- Contributors learn to work **on the real issue and then fake the timeline**

### Amplifying Factors
- Track metrics like “tickets closed” as a proxy for success
- Automatically generate reports that ignore off-system activity
- Penalize teams that move fast without pristine audit trails

### Countermeasures
- Use tools to **support visibility**, not define reality
- Encourage async updates, but value trusted conversations too
- Track **outcomes, not artifacts**
- Define “source of truth” as a shared narrative, not a checkbox log

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in “data-driven” orgs without context-driven judgment
