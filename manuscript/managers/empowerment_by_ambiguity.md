## Empowerment by Ambiguity

### Sabotage Technique
Declare teams _“empowered to decide”_.  
Avoid clarifying decision rights, constraints, or escalation paths.  
When teams make a call, criticize them for misalignment, overreach, or political naïveté.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Announce: *“You’re empowered — we trust your judgment.”*
- Refuse to answer questions like *“Do we have the authority to commit to this?”*
- Stay vague when asked about boundaries or stakeholder alignment
- When a decision causes friction, respond with: *“You should’ve known better.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams hesitate to act despite being “empowered”
- Frustration grows over mixed signals
- Risk-takers get punished, and others learn to wait for implicit approval
- Empowerment becomes synonymous with exposure

### Amplifying Factors
- Use terms like *“ownership mindset”* without giving actual latitude
- Discourage escalation as a sign of weakness
- Treat inconsistent responses as “healthy ambiguity”

### Countermeasures
- Pair empowerment with **explicit scope and fallback paths**
- Normalize *“confirming authority”* as a responsible act, not a weakness
- Define “empowered to act” vs. “empowered to recommend”

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in pseudo-flat orgs and vague leadership cultures
