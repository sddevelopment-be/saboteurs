## Weaponize the 360

### Sabotage Technique
Send out 360° review questionnaires to a person’s colleagues.  
Emphasize the importance of honest, constructive feedback and “growth-oriented” transparency.

Promise that input will be used for coaching only.Then, in private 1:1s, focus exclusively on negative or critical comments — without context or balance.    

Never follow up.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Send a formal, HR-branded 360° request with encouraging language like: *“This is about growth, not evaluation.”*
- Use questions like *“What’s one area they could improve?”* to ensure negative framing
- Filter responses and highlight only the critical or ambiguous ones
- In the coaching session, share vague summaries like *“Some people feel you can come across as distant.”*
- Refuse to provide examples or offer support
- Do not schedule follow-ups or track improvement
- If questioned, say: *“We just want you to be aware.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Defensive or withdrawn behavior from the person receiving feedback
- Distrust in review processes
- Peers become reluctant to give honest feedback again
- The subject feels shamed without being empowered to act

### Amplifying Factors
- Deliver the feedback just before performance evaluations
- Claim anonymity but hint at _“general team sentiment”_
- Frame the session as coaching but make it evaluative in tone
- Never clarify how the feedback was interpreted or selected

## Detection Clues
- _“I got a lot of vague criticism, but no suggestions.”_
- _“They said the feedback was anonymous, but it was clearly from [X].”_
- _“I asked what I should work on and got silence.”_
- _“No one ever mentioned any of this before.”_

### Countermeasures
- Ensure 360° feedback is always paired with context, coaching, and action framing
- Separate reflection tools from evaluation processes
- Empower feedback recipients to ask clarifying questions without fear
- Follow up over time — reinforce growth as a **supported journey**, not a judgment dump

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially likely in companies trying to simulate a _“growth culture”_ without doing the actual support work
