## Feedback Whiplash

### Sabotage Technique
Ask someone to change a behavior based on feedback.  
When they do, provide no response.  
Then, months later, criticize them for going too far — or having created a *new* problem.  
Pretend this was always obvious.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Give feedback like *“You need to be more assertive.”*
- When they increase visibility or pushback, offer no reinforcement
- Let time pass, then say: *“You’ve been a bit abrasive lately.”*
- Shift the goalposts: *“Balance is key.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Feedback recipients feel whiplashed and paranoid
- Growth becomes performative — then punished
- Staff disengage from developmental feedback
- Cultural trust erodes

### Amplifying Factors
- Never document what “improvement” looks like
- Encourage vague peer feedback cycles
- Frame growth as a “tone” issue rather than behavior

### Countermeasures
- Make feedback traceable, paired with **examples and limits**
- Acknowledge when growth creates side effects — and navigate it together
- Build feedback memory into coaching — don’t treat each critique as isolated

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially damaging in growth-driven orgs with poor follow-through
