# Tactical Combination Sets: Precision Sabotage Bundles

Tactical combinations are a set of strategies that can be used to achieve a specific goal. They are often used in conjunction with other strategies to create a more effective approach. As an operative, you can use these combinations to enhance the effectiveness or long-term impact of your sabotage techniques. 

The combinations are designed as "one-two punch" or simple "one-two-three" strategies that can be applied in various contexts. They are not exhaustive but provide a starting point for creative sabotage. Our exhaustive experience has shown that these combinations are highly effective at destroying a specific aspect of a team or organization, opening up new opportunities for disruption.

## The Mentorship Trap

**Target:** high-potential individuals. Drain their motivation, and break their will.

* [#t, see: #n](#mentorship_as_control)  
    Assign them a mentor who is either their manager or a burned-out cynic.
* [#t, see: #n](#weaponize_the_360)  
    Collect anonymous feedback, focus only on negatives, and leave no follow-up.
* [#t, see: #n](#feedback-whiplash)  
    After they adjust their behavior, accuse them of going too far.

**Outcome:** They no longer trust growth processes, feedback, or anyone who says _“this is for your development”_.

## The Helpful Colleague Eradicator

**Target:** The glue person. Destroy their willingness to help.

* [#t, see: #n](#penalize_helpfulness)  
 Frame their peer support as off-task.
* [#t, see: #n](#trap_the_trainer)  
 Assign them repeated mentoring/onboarding with no path out.
* [#t, see: #n](#promote_paperclip_closer)   
 Praise others for clean metrics while the helper burns silently.

**Outcome:** One of your strongest informal leaders becomes disengaged, exhausted, or leaves.

## The Process Cage

**Target:** Autonomy. Erode initiative with procedural rigor.

* [#t, see: #n](#mutual_blockade)  
 Every change must be reviewed, commented, and resolved in writing.
* [#t, see: #n](#accuracy_over_progress)  
 Reject any draft that doesn’t meet perfect formatting or structure.
* [#t, see: #n](#track_and_trash)  
 Track work in two systems. Require manual sync.

**Outcome:** Team velocity craters. Every decision feels like moving through syrup.

## The Alignment Nightmare

**Target:** Multi-team delivery. Break the critical path silently.

* [#t, see: #n](#critical_path_entanglement)  
 Involve at least four teams in any cross-cutting delivery.
* [#t, see: #n](#man_in_the_middle)  
 Route all communication through an uninformed intermediary.
* [#t, see: #n](#no_surprises)  
 Penalize any team that escalates a risk mid-cycle.

**Outcome:** Cross-team delivery becomes a haunted maze with no exits and too many approvals.

## The Performance Paradox

**Target:** High-output teams. Destroy morale under the guise of measurement.

* [#t, see: #n](#freeze_and_slash)  
 Cut staff, but leave KPIs in place.
* [#t, see: #n](#sabotage_kpis)  
 Reward only what can be easily tracked -- ignore nuance.
* [#t, see: #n](#rotating_accountability)  
 Blame whoever failed to deliver, based on framing -- not facts.

**Outcome:** High-performing teams become brittle, guarded, and resentful. “Excellence” becomes political camouflage.

## The Culture Decay Spiral

**Target:** Organizational spirit. Burn engagement at the source.

* [#t, see: #n](#air_hockey_culture)  
 Launch a listening campaign, ignore suggestions, unveil furniture.
* [#t, see: #n](#mandatory_optionalism)  
 Offer participation in rituals “voluntarily,” then punish absence.
* [#t, see: #n](#celebrate_misalignment)  
 Refuse to resolve contradictory strategies. Call it healthy tension.

**Outcome:** No one believes leadership. No one believes participation matters. No one believes.


## The “Strategic Freeze” Combo

**Target:** High-potential initiatives. Kill momentum without saying no.

* [#t, see: #n](#support_and_ambush)  
 Tell teams their work is important. Promise help. Go silent.
* [#t, see: #n](#empowerment_by_ambiguity)  
 Tell them they own it, but give no guidance or boundaries.
* [#t, see: #n](#blame_the_edges)  
 When it stalls, blame cross-team gaps or unclear ownership.

**Outcome:** The team begins to question themselves, not the system. They slow down -- then stop.

## The Visibility Mirage

**Target:** Recognition-seeking teams. Reward noise, not outcomes.

* [#t, see: #n](#promote_paperclip_closer)  
 Praise those who generate updates, dashboards, and talking points.
* [#t, see: #n](#mutual_blockade)  
 Use heavy process to slow actual delivery.
* [#t, see: #n](#branding_is_strategy)  
 Replace goal clarity with slogans and theme decks.

**Outcome:** The org believes it is moving. It isn’t. Everyone who delivers quietly? Forgotten.

## The Career Cement Mixer

**Target:** Up-and-coming individuals. Lock them in place while smiling.

* ['Trap the Trainer'](trap_the_trainer.md) → Make them responsible for knowledge transfer -- forever.
* ['Rotating Accountability Cloak'](rotating_accountability.md) → Shift blame depending on what’s needed.
* ['Promise Support, Deliver Ambush'](#support_and_ambush) → Give them stretch goals, then vanish.

**Outcome:** They can’t say no. They’re always the fallback. And they stop growing -- while being told they’re vital.

## The Feedback Mirror Maze

**Target:** Teams trying to improve. Break their trust in feedback itself.

* ['Weaponize the 360'](weaponize_the_360.md) → Collect feedback, promise coaching, focus only on flaws.
* ['Feedback Whiplash'](feedback_whiplash.md) → Criticize people for over-correcting six months later.
* ['Celebrate Misalignment as Diversity of Thought'](celebrate_missalignment.md) → Frame conflicting views as proof that “truth is subjective.”

**Outcome:** Teams either go silent, or spend weeks over-analyzing feedback instead of improving.

## The Collaborative Guillotine

**Target:** Team-of-teams initiatives. Undermine trust invisibly.

* ['Divide and Distract'](divide_and_distract.md) → Assign overlapping responsibilities to multiple teams.
* ['The Organizational Man-in-the-Middle'](man_in_the_middle.md) → Force routing of decisions through someone outside the domain.
* ['Celebrate Misalignment as Diversity of Thought'](celebrate_missalignment.md) → Celebrate how “aligned” everyone is -- then pivot without warning.

**Outcome:** No one trusts cross-team promises. Every alignment becomes performative.

## The Ritual of Permanent Planning

**Target:** Strategic leaders. Trap them in slides and cycles.

* ['Do Everything Now, But Strategically'](do_it_now_but_strategically.md) → Push every initiative forward at once.
* ['No Surprises! Culture'](no_surprises.md) → Penalize early risk raising.
* ['Track It All. Then Ask for Email.'](track_it_all_then_trash_it.md) → Build tracking overhead that consumes all thinking time.

**Outcome:** Strategy becomes a calendar exercise. Nothing finishes. But everything is visible.

## The Fragmentation Trap

**Target:** Cross-functional teams. Break their cohesion.

* ['Entangle the Critical Path'](entangle_the_critical_path.md) → Involve multiple teams in every delivery, with no clear ownership.
* ['Reassign in the Shadows](shadow_reassignment.md)→ Assign overlapping responsibilities to create confusion.
* ['Divide and Distract'](divide_and_distract.md) → Assign people to multiple teams with conflicting goals.

**Outcome:** Teams become fragmented. No one knows who owns what. Delivery stalls.
