{aside}

**Make work about proving you’re working.**

**Primary Weapon:** Administrative burden  
**Description:**  
Create a culture of excessive tracking, reporting, and process adherence that distracts from actual delivery.  

**Damage Radius:**  
- Operational clarity
- Delivery flow
- Trust in tooling and visibility

**Why It Wins:**  
It creates a culture where people spend more time justifying their existence than delivering value, leading to burnout and disengagement.
