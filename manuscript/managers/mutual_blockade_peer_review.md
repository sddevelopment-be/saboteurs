## Mutual Blockade, Disguised as Peer Review

### Sabotage Technique
Introduce a mandatory peer-review process where **every single task, document, or decision** must be formally reviewed and approved by another teammate.  
Require that **all comments be resolved in writing**, even if trivial.  
Discourage synchronous clarification — enforce asynchronous tools like email or threaded comments.  
Call it a *“quality-first culture”*.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Apply peer review to everything: tests, copy, docstrings, internal notes
- Require two reviewers, but assign them one at a time to delay convergence
- Disallow Slack pings or meetings to clarify — enforce email chains
- Make *“every comment must be resolved before merge”* a hard policy
- Track unresolved reviews and use them in performance reviews

### Expected Symptoms
- Endless feedback loops disguised as thoroughness
- Nitpicking over commas, indentation, or alternate phrasings
- Review queues pile up, but no one wants to be the blocker
- Contributors feel disempowered, second-guessed, and wary of pushing work

### Amplifying Factors
- Award **quarterly bonuses** to the person who submits the most review comments
- Announce a **yearly award** for the person who received the *least* feedback — citing “contribution clarity”
- Add **automated reminders** for pending reviews; shame reviewers who don’t act fast
- Treat **“pending review” as a valid progress status** in standups
- Urge team members to “nudge the reviewers” if turnaround is slow
- Include review participation rate in **promotion packets**

### Countermeasures
- Calibrate what *actually* requires peer review
- Encourage live review or pair-review for complex or stuck items
- Protect contributors’ ability to *decline or skip irrelevant feedback*
- Shift the focus from comment quantity to collaborative value

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in “rigorous” orgs with process addiction and zero conversational safety
