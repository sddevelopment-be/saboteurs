## FYI Firehose

### Sabotage Technique
Forward irrelevant announcements, management updates, or team artifacts to wide audiences with nothing but *“FYI”* as the message.  
Ensure the subject sounds urgent or official.  
Never clarify why the recipient needs to read it -- if at all.

### Field Deployment Instructions
- Forward messages without commentary (or just “Sharing broadly”)
- Include attachments no one asked for
- Mix truly important info with irrelevant fluff
- Frame it as “ensuring alignment” or “keeping people in the loop”
- When asked about context, respond vaguely: *“Thought you might need this.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Inbox fatigue and ignored updates
- People miss critical signals due to noise volume
- Others begin mirroring the behavior, creating a chain flood
- Real decisions buried under unread notifications

### Amplifying Factors
- Use team aliases or all-hands lists
- Layer messages across multiple platforms (email + chat + dashboard alert)
- Share updates from other departments without filtering
- Praise *“cross-team awareness”* at retro

### Countermeasures
- Require context headers in forward messages
- Train teams on signal vs. noise discipline
- Encourage unsubscribe culture for passive CC’ing
- Empower people to mute “FYI-only” threads

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`Medium`/`High` — Especially common in high-alignment orgs, newsletter-happy cultures, or those with poor signal-to-noise discipline.
