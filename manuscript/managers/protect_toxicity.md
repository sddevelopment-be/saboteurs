## Spin Conflict as Passion

### Sabotage Technique
When destructive behavior surfaces (aggression, dismissal, undermining) frame it as _“strong opinions”_ or _“passion”_. This reframing makes it seem like the aggressor is simply committed, rather than toxic.

Avoid confronting the power dynamic. Encourage others to adapt to the aggressor’s style.  
**Reward intensity, not safety.**

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- When someone raises concerns about tone or behavior, respond with: *“They just care a lot.”*
- Praise _“directness”_ when it favours senior voices, punish it when it comes from juniors
- Encourage _“honest conversations”_ without moderation
- Avoid facilitation or intervention, even when patterns become toxic

### Expected Symptoms
- Psychological safety erodes for everyone except the most dominant voices
- People stop pushing back, or only do so behind closed doors
- Exit interviews mention _“interpersonal friction”_ with no follow-up
- The aggressor becomes seen as untouchable

### Amplifying Factors
- Make the loudest person the de facto decision-maker
- Say things like: *“That’s just how they are — they mean well.”*
- Frame emotional withdrawal as lack of commitment

### Countermeasures
- Normalize feedback on **behavior, not intent**
- Balance psychological safety with accountability
- Train leads to protect contribution diversity — not tolerate dominance

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Particularly effective in orgs that reward charisma over collaboration
