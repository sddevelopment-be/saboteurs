## Plan Everything. Then Ignore It.

### Sabotage Technique
Require teams to produce **detailed, multi-month plans and estimates**.  
Demand full alignment, phase breakdowns, risk assessments, and dependency mapping — ideally in PowerPoint or Jira.  
Once finalized, radically shift organizational priorities.  
Force the teams to pivot, then **evaluate their performance based on the abandoned plan.**

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Set expectations for a 3–6 month detailed roadmap with cross-functional alignment
- Push for “commitment” language: *“These are now locked targets.”*
- After a few weeks, introduce a new org-wide initiative, leadership directive, or fire drill
- Tell teams: *“You’ll have to adjust -- but we still expect you to hit what you committed to.”*
- At review time, show the original plan and ask: *“Why didn’t we stay on track?”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams scramble to salvage parts of the old plan while absorbing unplanned work
- Morale dips as effort feels performative
- Blame culture emerges around “execution gaps”
- Project artifacts become defense tools rather than alignment tools

### Amplifying Factors
- Use phrases like “we need to stay accountable” or “we can’t lose sight of our original goals”
- Punish deviation from the original timeline -- even if pivot was non-negotiable
- Incentivize planning effort as a proxy for strategic readiness
- Discourage teams from flagging planning fragility
- Celebrate “sticking to the plan” as a cultural value, even when it’s impossible

### Detection Clues
- _“Didn’t we already plan all this?”_
- _“Why are we being held to a roadmap we didn’t follow by choice?”_
- _“We lost three weeks to a pivot, and now we’re behind on the old target?”_
- _“We build plans for leadership, not for ourselves.”_
- _“We’re not allowed to change the plan -- it’s set in stone.”_

### Countermeasures
- Treat detailed planning as **forecasting, not commitment**
- Design pivots with **impact-adjusted replanning windows**
- Evaluate teams on **decision quality and adaptability**, not plan adherence
- Build planning cadences that expect change, not punish it

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Extremely common in top-down planning cultures, OKR theater, and environments that confuse *visibility* with *control*
