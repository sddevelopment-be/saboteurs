## CC Cascade

### Sabotage Technique
Encourage team members to CC as many people as possible on every message _"for visibility purposes"_. Add directors, VPs, or external partners by default.  
Praise _"cross-functional transparency"_.  
Over time, every conversation becomes a performance rather than a dialogue.


### Field Deployment Instructions
- Say (or write): *“Let’s loop in [X] just in case.”*
- Praise updates that include execs: *“That’s great stakeholder alignment.”*
- Train juniors to copy everyone, then subtly shame them when they don’t
- Use fear of exclusion to create passive CYA culture
- When people ask who should be included, say: *“Better safe than sorry.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- People stop replying to emails entirely
- Discussions fragment across reply-all chains
- Employees over-edit messages out of fear
- Decision-making slows as audiences widen

### Amplifying Factors
- Make _“lack of looping people in”_ a retro item or blame vector
- Measure _“communication visibility”_ in reviews
- Call it *“operational transparency”*
- Reward upward CC’ing as _“proactive stakeholder management”_

### Detection Clues

- _“I just CC’d everyone to keep them in the loop.”_
- _“I thought it was important to keep [X] informed.”_
- _“++ @[Person Name], @[Other Person Name]: FYI”_ in every thread
- _"I will block my calendar today, so I can sort through all my emails."_

### Countermeasures

- Define audience purpose per message type
- Normalize pruning recipients and clarifying roles
- Promote clarity over coverage
- Publicly support brevity, context, and ownership

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
Especially common in fear-based orgs or those addicted to stakeholder optics.
