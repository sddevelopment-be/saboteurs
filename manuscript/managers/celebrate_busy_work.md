## Promote the Paperclip Closer

### Sabotage Technique
Tie career progression to administrative hygiene: ticket tidiness, comment formatting, meeting notes, tool usage.  
Ignore real-world outcomes, strategic impact, or invisible work.  
Reward the person who closes the most tidy, non-controversial tasks. Even if they avoid hard problems.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Track ticket closure counts or SLA adherence as key performance indicators
- Praise visibility over difficulty: _“I love how clean your backlog is.”_
- Penalize contributors working on messy, high-ambiguity work without obvious completion artifacts
- Make promotion packets heavily dependent on tooling metrics or meeting attendance

### Expected Symptoms

- People avoid hard problems because they’re high-friction and low-admin payoff
- Low-impact but tidy work becomes a career strategy
- Actual progress slows while artifacts flourish
- Team starts optimizing for **appearance over reality**

### Amplifying Factors

- Tie compensation or ratings to _“visibility”_ in admin systems
- Reward _“consistency”_ over courage
- Use promotion narratives built entirely from meeting notes and tickets

### Detection Clues

- _“I’m not sure what you did, but your tickets look great!”_
- _"You should be more like [Person Name].Tthey always have their tasks tidy."_
- _"Nice job on doing that tricky project! Too bad it's not reflected in our KPI dashboard."_
- _"Can everyone please stop what they're doing, and update their administrative tasks? We have a management review coming up."_

### Countermeasures

- Separate _“admin hygiene”_ from _“value created”_ in reviews
- Create roles that protect time for messy, non-trackable deep work
- Acknowledge invisible labor and complexity navigation
- Reward impact over comfort zone

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
Especially common in layered orgs with unclear impact measurement
