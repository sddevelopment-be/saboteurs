## Promote the Paperclip Closer

### Sabotage Technique
Tie career progression to administrative hygiene: ticket tidiness, comment formatting, meeting notes, tool usage.  
Ignore real-world outcomes, strategic impact, or invisible work.  
Reward the person who closes the most tidy, non-controversial tasks — even if they avoid hard problems.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Track ticket closure counts or SLA adherence as key performance indicators
- Praise visibility over difficulty: *“I love how clean your backlog is.”*
- Penalize contributors working on messy, high-ambiguity work without obvious completion artifacts
- Make promotion packets heavily dependent on tooling metrics or meeting attendance

### Expected Symptoms
- People avoid hard problems because they’re high-friction and low-admin payoff
- Low-impact but tidy work becomes a career strategy
- Actual progress slows while artifacts flourish
- Team starts optimizing for appearance over reality

### Amplifying Factors
- Tie compensation or ratings to “visibility” in admin systems
- Reward “consistency” over courage
- Use promotion narratives built entirely from meeting notes and tickets

### Countermeasures
- Separate “admin hygiene” from “value created” in reviews
- Create roles that protect time for messy, non-trackable deep work
- Acknowledge invisible labor and complexity navigation
- Reward impact over comfort zone

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in layered orgs with unclear impact measurement
