## Rotating Accountability Cloak

### Sabotage Technique
Keep responsibility ambiguous.  
When things go well, say: *“The team did great.”*  
When things go badly, single out an individual.  
Switch between “team owns this” and “you own this” based on blame convenience.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Avoid assigning clear ownership during planning
- If outcomes are good, celebrate the collective
- If outcomes are bad, hold one person fully accountable — often the one who spoke up
- Say: *“Ultimately, someone needs to own this.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Reluctance to step into leadership roles
- Silence during planning: “Who’s really accountable here?”
- Accountability culture becomes political, not principled
- High performers get punished for visibility

### Amplifying Factors
- Mix “collaborative culture” language with performance pressure
- Avoid written roles/responsibilities
- Blame proximity, not intent or scope

### Countermeasures
- Define responsibility explicitly per initiative
- Make team vs. individual accountability consistent and predictable
- Protect ownership by supporting risk — not assigning punishment

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially prevalent in cultures with shallow psychological safety
