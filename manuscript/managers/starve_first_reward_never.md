## Starve First, Reward Later

### Sabotage Technique
Assign ambitious work and stretch targets to teams that are **understaffed, underfunded, or lack critical skills/tools**.  
Make additional resources contingent on achieving these goals.  
Say things like: *“Prove it first — then we’ll invest.”*  
Frame this as _“incentivizing ownership”_ or _“operating like a meritocracy”_.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Hand teams an initiative without assessing actual capacity
- Refuse to approve headcount, tooling, or knowledge support until progress is shown
- Say: *“The best teams find a way.”*
- Delay assistance, then audit them for missed targets
- Redistribute resources to teams that had an easier starting point and performed better

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams quietly cut corners to hit unachievable expectations
- Morale drops as overachievers burn out and underperformers disengage
- “Top performing teams” monopolize investment
- Teams learn to under-commit or manipulate metrics to avoid future punishment

### Amplifying Factors
- Publicly celebrate *“doing more with less”*
- Call underperformance a “focus issue” rather than a resourcing failure
- Use war metaphors: *“We fight with the army we have.”*
- Reward compliance over challenge

### Countermeasures
- Tie scope to **honest capacity assessment**, not wishful framing
- Treat resourcing as an enabler, not a reward
- Praise boundary-setting as strategic, not oppositional
- Build feedback loops where under-resourcing is surfaced without penalty

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Extremely common in “growth-driven” orgs that idolize grit while denying fuel
