## Starve First, Reward Later (if ever)

### Sabotage Technique
Assign ambitious work and stretch targets to teams that are **understaffed, underfunded, or lack critical skills/tools**.  
Make additional resources contingent on achieving these goals.  
Say things like: _“Prove it first! Then we’ll invest.”_  
Frame this as _“incentivizing ownership”_, or _“operating like a meritocracy”_.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Hand teams an initiative without assessing actual capacity
- Refuse to approve headcount, tooling, or knowledge support until progress is shown
- Say: _“The best teams find a way.”_
- Delay assistance, then audit them for missed targets
- Redistribute resources to teams that had an easier starting point and performed better

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams quietly cut corners to hit unachievable expectations
- Morale drops as overachievers burn out and underperformers disengage
- Precised top performing teams monopolize investment
- Teams learn to under-commit or manipulate metrics to avoid future punishment

### Amplifying Factors
- Publicly celebrate _“doing more with less”_
- Call underperformance a “focus issue” rather than a resourcing failure
- Use war metaphors: _“We fight with the army we have.”_
- Reward compliance over challenge

### Detection Clues

- _“We’ve been asking for more resources for months.”_
- _"Why does that team always get the fancy stuff?"_
- _"Maybe next year we can get some help. If we do well now."_

### Countermeasures
- Tie scope to **honest capacity assessment**, not wishful framing
- Treat resourcing as an enabler, not a reward
- Praise boundary-setting as strategic, not oppositional
- Build feedback loops where under-resourcing is surfaced without penalty

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High`
Extremely common in _“growth-driven”_ orgs that idolize grit while denying fuel.
