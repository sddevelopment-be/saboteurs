## Accuracy Over Progress

### Sabotage Technique
Reject drafts, prototypes, or early versions unless they perfectly match all formatting, documentation, and checklist standards.  
Refuse to review or move forward until every detail is _“finalized”_.  
Use bureaucracy to **freeze momentum**.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Demand full planning doc completion before approving any technical spike
- Reject architectural sketches unless they use official tooling or notation
- Return proposals with feedback like _“please add the missing metadata fields first”_
- Stop early-stage discussions if agendas, headers, or templates aren’t used

### Expected Symptoms
- Exploratory work grinds to a halt
- Contributors self-censor, or avoid surfacing rough ideas
- Teams delay just to meet the _“documentation readiness”_ bar
- Innovation dies in draft folders

### Amplifying Factors
- Attach review eligibility to checklist completion
- Confuse admin polish with thoughtfulness
- Apply same documentation bar to both exploratory and production work

### Detection Clues

- _“We can’t start until we have the full spec.”_
- _“This is just a draft, so I’m not going to review it.”_
- _"Was your idea fully vetted through the 'readiness' checklist?"_

### Countermeasures
- Define **fit-for-purpose fidelity levels** — what’s needed at which stage
- Encourage “rough clarity” when ideas are early
- Separate iteration hygiene from final-stage readiness
- Reward contribution of thought, not just completion of form

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
Especially common in risk-averse or over-structured organizations.
