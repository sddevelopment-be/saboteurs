## Accuracy Over Progress

### Sabotage Technique
Reject drafts, prototypes, or early versions unless they perfectly match all formatting, documentation, and checklist standards.  
Refuse to review or move forward until every detail is “finalized.”  
Use bureaucracy to freeze momentum.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Demand full planning doc completion before approving any technical spike
- Reject architectural sketches unless they use official tooling or notation
- Return proposals with feedback like “please add the missing metadata fields first”
- Stop early-stage discussions if agendas, headers, or templates aren’t used

### Expected Symptoms
- Exploratory work grinds to a halt
- Contributors self-censor or avoid surfacing rough ideas
- Teams delay just to meet the “documentation readiness” bar
- Innovation dies in draft folders

### Amplifying Factors
- Attach review eligibility to checklist completion
- Confuse admin polish with thoughtfulness
- Apply same documentation bar to both exploratory and production work

### Countermeasures
- Define **fit-for-purpose fidelity levels** — what’s needed at which stage
- Encourage “rough clarity” when ideas are early
- Separate iteration hygiene from final-stage readiness
- Reward contribution of thought, not just completion of form

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in risk-averse or over-structured organizations
