## Thread Drift

### Sabotage Technique
Hijack active message threads by subtly shifting the topic.  
Reply to email chains with tangents.  
Inject *“related concerns”* into Slack threads or comment chains.  
Do it politely, do it often.  
Frame it as __“connecting the dots”.__

### Field Deployment Instructions
- Add loosely related thoughts to existing threads
- Ask meta-questions like: *“How does this tie into Initiative Z?”*
- Apologize for the tangent, but double down
- Pivot from the original purpose, bury the actionable conversation
- When asked to move it elsewhere, say: *“I thought this was relevant.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Threads become bloated, irrelevant, or unreadable
- Original action items get lost mid-scroll
- Team energy dissipates across multiple unresolved micro topics
- Contributors begin holding back, waiting for focus

### Amplifying Factors
- Use bot integrations to insert tangents (*"X mentioned in Z channel!"*)
- Quote earlier parts of the thread to pretend it’s still on-topic
- Suggest spinoff conversations, but never start them
- Frame it all as *“zooming out”*

### Countermeasures
- Declare thread purpose up front (e.g. `[DECISION]`, `[FYI]`, `[ACTION]`)
- Create a culture of redirecting -- *“good point, new thread?”*
- Nominate discussion facilitators for key channels
- Promote sync discussion when async derails

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High` – Extremely common in flat teams or “thinking out loud” cultures
