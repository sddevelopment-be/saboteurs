## Freeze Targets, Slash Staff

### Sabotage Technique
Establish annual performance targets based on a fully staffed team.  
Make them visible, trackable, and tied to evaluations.  
Then, in the final quarter, conduct major layoffs or reassignments -- but leave the original targets untouched.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Define KPIs in Q1 based on current team capacity
- Include language like *“ambitious but achievable”* in exec presentations
- Publicly align targets with _“strategic priorities”_
- In Q4, initiate workforce reduction, project reallocation, or major org reshuffle
- Reaffirm that _“the goals haven’t changed”_ to preserve focus
- When teams fall short, attribute it to **execution issues**, not **resource collapse**

### Expected Symptoms
- Burnout among remaining staff
- Quiet resentment and drop in trust
- Attempts to shield leadership from reality
- Gamification, scope trimming, or quiet quitting
- Involuntary prioritization by attrition

### Amplifying Factors
- Say _“we’re trusting the team to rise to the challenge”_
- Publicly celebrate the resilience of those who remain
- Use lagging indicators to retroactively justify that *“some teams still made it”*
- Privately track progress but don’t revise expectations
- Give yourself a pat on the back for _“keeping the team focused”_, assign yourself a bonus for _"optimizing and rationalizing"_ the team

### Detection Clues
- _“Nothing’s changed -- the bar is still the same.”_
- _“We know it’s been a tough year, but we’re counting on you.”_
- _“Now’s the time to show what you’re capable of.”_
- _“This is where high performers shine.”_

### Countermeasures
- Tie KPIs to **resource-adjusted baselines**, not legacy plans
- Normalize quarterly KPI recalibration windows
- Make *structural capacity shifts* a first-class reason for target review
- Build the cultural courage to say: *“We are now doing less, on purpose.”*

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in large orgs trying to maintain optics through turbulence
