## Promise Support, Deliver Ambush

### Sabotage Technique
When someone requests your guidance or decision, promise to _“look into it and get back to them.”_  
Disappear for two months.  
Then reappear -- urgently -- demanding a status update and emphasizing the strategic importance of the initiative.  
If they made any progress, scold them for _“moving without alignment”_.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Respond to requests for clarity with: “Good question. Let me check and get back to you.”
- Avoid any follow-up. Let the silence stretch.
- When attention resurfaces (deadline, visibility, or external pressure), suddenly escalate interest.
- Call for an urgent sync. Ask: *“Where are we on this?”*
- If the team made progress, point out flaws, missed context, or how they misunderstood your original intent
- Reassert control: *“Next time, wait for input.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Psychological hesitation in ICs and team leads
- Over-cautious behavior and chronic “waiting for approval” patterns
- Work stalls due to lack of top-cover
- Risk-averse culture where autonomy feels like a trap

### Amplifying Factors
- Frame your absence as “being strategic”
- Use terms like _“alignment”_, _“governance”_, or _“orchestration”_ when re-engaging
- Avoid paper trails
- Privately reward teams that do nothing without permission

### Detection Clues
- “We were waiting for your go-ahead.”
- “We didn’t want to act without confirmation.”
- “We assumed this wasn’t a priority anymore.”
- “I thought you were still looking into it.”

### Countermeasures
- Set response deadlines for deferred guidance: *“If we don’t hear back by [X], we’ll proceed with [Y].”*
- Make unblocking requests traceable and time-bound
- Normalize _“assumed green light”_ if leadership silence exceeds a threshold
- Build language like: *“We moved forward based on the last available context.”*

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially prevalent in mid-management bottlenecks, complex approval chains, or power-hoarding orgs
