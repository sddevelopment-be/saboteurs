## Promise Support, Deliver Ambush

### Sabotage Technique
When someone requests your guidance or decision, promise to _“look into it and get back to them.”_  
**Disappear for two months.**  
Then reappear, urgently demanding a status update and emphasizing the strategic importance of the initiative.  
If they made any progress, scold them for _"moving without alignment"_. If they didn’t, criticize them for _"not taking initiative"_.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Respond to requests for clarity with: _“Good question. Let me check and get back to you.”_
- **Avoid any follow-up**. Let the silence stretch.
- When attention resurfaces (deadline, visibility, or external pressure), suddenly escalate interest.
- Call for an urgent sync. Ask: _“Where are we on this?”_
- If the team made progress, point out flaws, missed context, or how they misunderstood your original intent
- Reassert control: _“Next time, wait for input.”_

### Expected Symptoms
- Psychological hesitation in ICs and team leads
- Over-cautious behavior and chronic “waiting for approval” patterns
- Work stalls due to lack of top-cover
- Risk-averse culture where autonomy feels like a trap

### Amplifying Factors
- Frame your absence as “being strategic”
- Use terms like _“alignment”_, _“governance”_, or _“orchestration”_ when re-engaging
- Avoid paper trails
- Privately reward teams that do nothing without permission

### Detection Clues
- _“We were waiting for your go-ahead.”_
- _"I thought you were still looking into it.”_
- _“We assumed this wasn’t a priority anymore.”_
- _“We didn’t want to act without confirmation.”_
- _"I went ahead on the preparations, please don't tell anyone."_

### Countermeasures
- Set response deadlines for deferred guidance: _“If we don’t hear back by [X], we’ll proceed with [Y].”_
- Make unblocking requests traceable and time-bound
- Normalize _“assumed green light”_ if leadership silence exceeds a threshold
- Build language like: _“We moved forward based on the last available context.”_

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High`  
Especially prevalent in mid-management bottlenecks, complex approval chains, or power-hoarding orgs.
