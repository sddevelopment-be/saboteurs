## Do Everything Now, But Strategically

### Sabotage Technique
Launch all major initiatives simultaneously.  
Refuse to prioritize.  
Then criticize teams for failing to act strategically, maintain quality, or think long-term.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Start multiple “top-priority” projects with urgent messaging
- Discourage pushback: *“We need to be agile.”*
- When burnout hits, blame teams for lacking planning maturity
- Say: *“You need to see the bigger picture.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Context switching, half-done initiatives, and diluted ownership
- Poor architecture or shortcuts justified by velocity
- Teams stop believing priorities are real
- Strategy becomes a buzzword for “more effort with no direction”

### Amplifying Factors
- Penalize pause or refocus requests
- Use OKRs to stack initiatives vertically
- Maintain a “go fast” culture but demand retrospective excellence

### Countermeasures
- Force-rank initiatives — don’t claim they’re all #1
- Build intentional pause points into the roadmap
- Link “doing less” to long-term impact

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Common in orgs that mistake urgency for strategic intent
