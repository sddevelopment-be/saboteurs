## Entangle the Critical Path

### Sabotage Technique
Design the critical path of a project so that no single team can deliver any meaningful outcome without **waiting for multiple other teams**.  
Make sure every handoff, dependency, or approval touches at least one external group.  
The more teams involved, the slower and more fragile it becomes — but frame it as “cross-functional collaboration.”

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Split the project into fine-grained phases, and assign each phase to a different team
- Avoid end-to-end ownership: enforce micro-deliverables that require signoff from other teams
- For each dependency, require a formal alignment session
- Create complex coordination matrices and say: *“We need buy-in from everyone before we can proceed.”*
- If someone questions the design, say: *“It’s important that everyone is represented.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams blocked by others' delays or vague delivery promises
- Meetings about progress become **meetings about waiting**
- Inter-team blame spirals emerge when deadlines slip
- Ownership of failure becomes too diffused to address

### Amplifying Factors
- Make one of the dependencies **an overloaded platform team** with no delivery commitment
- Require weekly syncs to “stay aligned” instead of resolving blockers
- Introduce a RACI matrix that gives everyone veto power and no one autonomy
- Prohibit informal collaboration: everything must go through process

### Detection Clues
- “We’re waiting on [team X] to finish their part.”
- “We can’t test it until [team Y] provisions access.”
- “We’ll know more after next Tuesday’s multi-team sync.”
- “No one’s accountable for this end-to-end — it’s shared.”

### Countermeasures
- Minimize the number of teams on the critical path; enable **end-to-end vertical slices**
- Assign **temporary autonomy** for integrated delivery where speed matters
- Flag every additional dependency as a risk, not a virtue
- Make ownership and sequencing **explicit and revisable**, not politically frozen

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in scaled orgs with low trust and a culture of “alignment over flow”
