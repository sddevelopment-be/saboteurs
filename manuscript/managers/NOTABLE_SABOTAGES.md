## 1. Simulate Cultural Change, Then Install an Air Hockey Table

**Category:** Cultural Manipulation  
**Primary Weapon:** Hope, repurposed  
**Description:**  
Orchestrate large-scale listening and engagement efforts. Burn out the most thoughtful employees. Hold a leadership offsite. Post pictures. Deliver a furniture upgrade. Change nothing else.

**Damage Radius:**

- Organizational trust
- Emotional resilience
- Long-term engagement

**Why It Wins:**  
It doesn’t just fail to change the culture. It **kills the belief that change is possible.**

## 2. Track Everything. Align Nothing.

**Category:** Administrative Overload  
**Primary Weapon:** Forced compliance  
**Description:**  
Introduce conflicting tracking systems. Force manual alignment. Routinely replace one system. Leaders request updates via Slack anyway.

**Damage Radius:**

- Operational clarity
- Delivery flow
- Trust in tooling and visibility

**Why It Wins:**  
It destroys both **belief in systems** and **confidence in leadership alignment** — while generating perfect audit trails.

## 3. Mutual Blockade, Disguised as Peer Review

**Category:** Process Worship / Collaboration Friction  
**Primary Weapon:** Weaponized helpfulness  
**Description:**  
Mandate peer review on everything. Enforce comment resolution. Ban sync discussion. Reward reviewers. Punish velocity.

**Damage Radius:**

- Autonomy
- Delivery speed
- Psychological safety

**Why It Wins:**  
It creates **mutually assured obstruction** while appearing thoughtful and thorough.

## 4. Mentorship as Control or Contempt

**Category:** Misapplied Care Structures  
**Primary Weapon:** Hollow support  
**Description:**  
Launch a mentorship program, but pair people only with their direct managers or socially toxic veterans. Frame it as professional development.

**Damage Radius:**

- Psychological safety
- Informal support networks
- Retention of emerging talent

**Why It Wins:**  
It turns trust-building structures into **mechanisms of containment and shame**.

## 5. Set Metrics That Incentivize Sabotage

**Category:** Metric Gaming / Performance Theater  
**Primary Weapon:** Quantified dysfunction  
**Description:**  
Reward visibility, quantity, or meaningless throughput. Penalize invisible labor. Promote the data performer, not the system stabilizer.

**Damage Radius:**

- Integrity of goals
- Team alignment
- Collaboration

**Why It Wins:**  
It turns the measurement system into a **force-multiplier for misaligned behavior** — all under the banner of objectivity.
