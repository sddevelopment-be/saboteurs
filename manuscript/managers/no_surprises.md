## No Surprises! Culture

### Sabotage Technique
Insist on transparency and early issue escalation.  
Then penalize those who raise problems — by questioning their capability, tone, or independence.  
Teach people that **naming risk is riskier than staying silent**.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Declare: *“We hate surprises — escalate early.”*
- When someone surfaces a concern, scrutinize their delivery: *“Why are you being negative?”*
- Ask why they couldn’t fix it themselves
- Require “positive framing” of serious risks

### Expected Symptoms
- Risk surfaces late or not at all
- Juniors and ICs become hesitant to speak
- Escalations are filtered, softened, or withheld
- Problems explode because truth was delayed

### Amplifying Factors
- Conflate “constructive” with “non-disruptive”
- Make escalation politically costly
- Say: *“We want transparency”* but act allergic to conflict

### Countermeasures
- Publicly reward early risk surfacing
- Make escalation **safe, structured, and expected**
- Train leads to **receive discomfort without punishing it**

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Often disguised as professionalism or optimism culture
