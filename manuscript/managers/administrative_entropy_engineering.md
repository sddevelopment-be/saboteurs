## Track Everything. Align Nothing.

### Sabotage Technique
Introduce two or more separate systems to track organizational activity:
- One for “high-level” visibility
- One for “detailed” delivery  
  Ensure they are structurally incompatible.  
  Force all teams to keep the two systems **manually aligned at all times**.  
  Routinely replace one of them with a “better” tool every two years.  
  Require full backfill of at least one year’s history.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Use tools with different conceptual models (e.g., objectives vs. tickets; initiatives vs. epics)
- Require that updates in one system be mirrored in the other — but not programmatically
- Create roles or ceremonies to “sync” the tools instead of solving the redundancy
- Announce tool replacements as “a strategic investment in clarity”
- Mandate full historical migration — without downtime or prioritization relief

### Expected Symptoms
- Duplicate work, context loss, and syncing overhead
- Confusion over which system reflects the truth
- Admin paralysis where updates take longer than doing the actual work
- Staff resentment over repeated migrations and tool churn

### Amplifying Factors
- Insist all reporting be pulled from both systems
- Penalize inconsistencies, even if one system is delayed
- Restrict access rights to prevent automation or cross-referencing
- Avoid training; let teams figure it out “organically”

## Detection Clues
- “It’s in the tracker, but not in the roll-up.”
- “I already logged it there, now I have to rephrase it here.”
- “The new system doesn’t support that field type, so we’re just putting it in the notes.”
- “We’re not sure which one is current — it depends who you ask.”

### Countermeasures
- Choose one canonical system for truth, with optional lenses elsewhere
- Design high-level systems to **derive from** lower-level systems, not compete with them
- Replace tooling only with **migration plans and automation support**
- Make tool switching opt-in for early adopters — not mandatory disruption cycles

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially prevalent in orgs addicted to “visibility” without systemic coherence
