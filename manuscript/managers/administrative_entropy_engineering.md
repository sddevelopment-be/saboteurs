## Track Everything. Align Nothing.

### Sabotage Technique
Introduce two or more separate systems to track organizational activity: One for high-level visibility; One for detailed delivery.  
  Ensure they are structurally incompatible.  
  Force all teams to keep the two systems **manually aligned at all times**.  
  Routinely replace one of them with a _“better”_ tool (every two years or so).  
  Require full backfill of at least one year’s history.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Use tools with different conceptual models (e.g., objectives vs. tickets; initiatives vs. epics)
- Require that updates in one system be mirrored in the other. But not programmatically, as that would be _"wasting time for a one-off migration"_.
- Create roles or ceremonies to sync the tools instead of solving the redundancy
- Announce tool replacements as _“a strategic investment in clarity”_
- Mandate full historical migration. To be done without downtime or prioritization relief

### Expected Symptoms
- Duplicate work, context loss, and syncing overhead
- Confusion over which system reflects the truth
- Admin paralysis where **updates take longer than doing the actual work**
- Staff resentment over repeated migrations and tool churn

### Amplifying Factors
- Insist all reporting be pulled from both systems
- Penalize inconsistencies, even if one system is delayed
- Restrict access rights to prevent automation or cross-referencing
- Avoid training; let teams figure it out “organically”

### Detection Clues
- _“It’s in the tracker, but not in the roll-up.”_
- _“I already logged it there, now I have to rephrase it here.”_
- _“The new system doesn’t support that field type, so we’re just putting it in the notes.”_
- _“We’re not sure which one is current — it depends who you ask.”_

### Countermeasures
- Choose one canonical system for truth, with optional lenses elsewhere
- Design high-level systems to **derive from** lower-level systems, not compete with them
- Replace tooling only with **migration plans and automation support**
- Make tool switching opt-in for early adopters — not mandatory disruption cycles

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
Especially prevalent in orgs addicted to _“visibility”_ without systemic coherence.
