## Reassign in the Shadows

### Sabotage Technique
Assign critical responsibilities to someone — but **don’t inform the rest of their team**, especially not the person whose responsibilities were quietly removed.  

Let the confusion unfold organically.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- In a 1:1 or leadership huddle, ask someone to “take ownership” of a domain or function
- Avoid documenting the change or broadcasting it
- Do **not** clarify who no longer owns the domain
- Let the original owner continue to act until the overlap becomes apparent through conflict or contradiction
- When confusion arises, act surprised: *“I assumed you were all aligned.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Overlapping work, duplicated effort, or neglected responsibilities
- Emotional tension, erosion of trust, and behind-the-scenes venting
- Delays caused by uncertainty in authority or ownership
- The person left out feels **betrayed and confused**, while the newly assigned person feels **politically exposed**

### Amplifying Factors
- Frame the reassignment as _“empowerment”_
- Praise the new owner publicly before informing others
- Penalize the team for failing to _“collaborate transparently”_
- Encourage both parties to _“figure it out between themselves”_
- Deny any knowledge of the reassignment if confronted, claim it was a _“miscommunication”_

## Detection Clues
- _“I thought that was still my responsibility.”_
- _“Why wasn’t this discussed with the team?”_
- _“Wait, who’s actually owning this now?”_
- _“I found out only when I was removed from the thread.”_

### Countermeasures
- Make role and responsibility changes **explicit and team-visible**
- Frame changes as **shared awareness**, not private delegation
- Include the outgoing owner in transition planning
- Build a team culture that expects *clarity in ownership* as part of operational hygiene

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Common in fast-moving teams, unclear leadership models, or politicized environments
