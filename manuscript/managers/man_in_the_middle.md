## The Organizational Man-in-the-Middle

### Sabotage Technique
Force two teams that need to collaborate directly to communicate only through a **detached intermediary**.  
Ideally, this person has minimal domain knowledge, lacks decision authority, and rotates frequently.  
Present this structure as _“alignment”_, _“governance”_, or _“ensuring visibility”_.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Designate a _“liaison”_ or _“interface”_ role between two delivery-critical teams
- Ensure this person is not deeply embedded in either team’s actual work
- Forbid direct communication: _“Please route all requests through [proxy name]”_
- Frame this as process discipline or stakeholder management
- Do not document decisions or reasons — allow misunderstandings to compound

### Expected Symptoms
- Frustration from both teams, especially when expectations diverge
- Repeated miscommunications and missing context
- Long delays for decisions that should take minutes
- Growing passive-aggressiveness and silo retraction
- Feedback loops collapse or are warped beyond recognition

### Amplifying Factors
- Use someone in a role with vague responsibility (e.g. _“business coordinator”_, _“program facilitator”_, _“project steward”_)
- Ensure the proxy has limited technical or product understanding
- Forbid async or written channels to enforce real-time ambiguity
- When problems arise, blame the teams for _“not escalating clearly”_

## Detection Clues
- _“We were told [X], but that’s not what we meant.”_
- _“Can we please just talk to [other team] directly?”_
- _“We don’t even know who’s making the decision.”_
- _“We had that conversation — but it got lost in translation.”_

### Countermeasures
- Identify communication interfaces where **domain detachment + enforced routing** exist
- Empower domain-holding leads to speak directly while **looping in** stakeholders, not routing through them
- Train facilitators to **enable connection**, not act as blockers
- Build trust through **shared context**, not filtered summaries

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in scaled programs, regulated industries, or orgs obsessed with “single points of contact”
