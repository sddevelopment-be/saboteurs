## Divide and Distract

### Sabotage Technique
Assign someone to two or more active teams simultaneously.  
Ensure both teams expect full ownership, availability, and accountability.  
Claim this is a sign of trust in their versatility.  
Do not coordinate expectations or clarify priorities.  
Then feign surprise when progress stalls.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Split the person across teams with conflicting goals, rhythms, and ceremonies
- Avoid scheduling protection: let meetings collide
- Say: *“They’re 50/50”* or *“It’s a soft split — they’ll manage”*
- Let both teams believe the person is “mostly dedicated” to them
- During reviews, focus exclusively on what didn’t get done

### Expected Symptoms
- Burnout from constant context switching
- Friction with both teams due to perceived unreliability
- Poorly maintained work artifacts, divided attention, late handoffs
- The individual becomes a bottleneck in two places at once

### Amplifying Factors
- Assign them to teams in **different time zones** or **competing delivery cadences**
- Let them handle stakeholder communication in both domains
- Penalize them for “lack of visibility” or missed updates in either stream
- Never adjust scope — just expectations

### Detection Clues
- “Wait, aren’t they in our standup?”
- “I thought they were 80% here.”
- “We need them for a critical path item, but they’re in a planning meeting for the other team.”
- “They’re doing a little bit of everything… and can’t finish anything.”

### Countermeasures
- Treat multi-team assignment as an **exception**, not a default
- Assign **explicit prioritization authority** — one team must come first
- Protect calendar blocks and reduce ceremony duplication
- Count **fragmentation cost** when planning delivery

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in matrix orgs, resource-optimized environments, or during stealth re-orgs
