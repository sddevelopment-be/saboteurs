## Mandatory Optionalism

### Sabotage Technique
Announce a new initiative, process, or ritual as “completely optional.”  
Then track who participates.  
Reward those who conform. Quietly penalize those who opt out.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Introduce new ceremonies as *“just a tool — use it if it helps!”*
- Later, correlate participation with team engagement or cultural fit
- In performance reviews, mention who’s “leaning in”
- For nonparticipants, note: *“They’re not very visible.”*

### Expected Symptoms
- Ritual fatigue, silent resentment
- Teams participate to avoid being marked
- Contributors who value autonomy begin to disengage
- “Optional” becomes synonymous with “expected”

### Amplifying Factors
- Use dashboards to show opt-in rates
- Celebrate early adopters as “model contributors”
- Say: *“You don’t have to join — we’ll just assume you’re aligned.”*

### Countermeasures
- Clarify which processes are **truly optional**, and why
- Separate cultural rituals from **performance proxies**
- Allow real opt-out without social tax

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Extremely common in “culture-driven” environments with implicit power dynamics
