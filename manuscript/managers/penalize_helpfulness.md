## Penalize Informal Help

### Sabotage Technique

When a colleague goes out of their way to help others — especially new joiners or struggling teammates — frame it as *“off the clock”* or *“distracting from their core duties.”*  

Point to the fact that *“we already have a formal mentorship program”*, *"there is an onboarding track"*, or *“knowledge sharing is part of someone else's role”*.

Undermine all informal care by wrapping it in process.

###  Field Deployment Instructions

- Identify those who regularly step in to explain context, unblock peers, or quietly mentor
- Call them out in performance conversations: *“You seem spread thin — let’s focus on your objectives.”*
- Emphasize productivity metrics that ignore collaboration
- Reassign work if they "fall behind"
- Praise them publicly for being “a great culture carrier,” but penalize them privately for time spent helping

### Expected Symptoms

- Helpful people burn out or go quiet
- New team members struggle to get informal support
- Psychological safety declines as people become “too busy to care”
- Collaboration becomes riskier than compliance

### Amplifying Factors
- Reference RACI charts or org structure when someone asks for help
- Say things like: *“Let’s respect everyone’s time”*, or *“We have channels for that.”*
- Measure success only by assigned tickets or output velocity
- Use performance reviews to highlight *“time spent on core tasks”* over team health
- Ensure mentees feel guilty for needing help: *“I don’t want to be a burden.”*
- Make sure it is highly unclear who is responsible for formal mentoring

### Countermeasures
- Recognize and reward invisible labor explicitly
- Create time-safe space for informal mentoring and unblocking
- Redefine “productivity” to include system health — not just personal metrics
- Encourage, don’t penalize, _“unauthorized kindness”_

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Especially common in output-obsessed orgs with shallow collaboration culture
