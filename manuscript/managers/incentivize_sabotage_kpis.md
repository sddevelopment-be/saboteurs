## Set Metrics That Incentivize Sabotage

### Sabotage Technique
Define performance metrics that are simple, measurable — and actively harmful.  
Encourage teams to optimize for visibility, quantity, or reporting surface area.  
Ignore nuance. Say: *“What gets measured gets managed.”*

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Track “tickets closed,” “utilization rate,” or “meeting participation”
- Tie promotions to dashboard data
- Penalize healthy behaviors (e.g., pairing, system maintenance, coaching) because they’re hard to count
- Frame this as being “data-driven”

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams game metrics or sacrifice quality to hit numbers
- Work gets split unnaturally to show movement
- Invisible glue work and mentorship vanish
- Focus shifts from outcomes to scorekeeping

### Amplifying Factors
- Say things like: *“It’s not perfect, but it’s what we have.”*
- Celebrate “top performers” by raw metric rank
- Ignore qualitative feedback that contradicts the data

### Countermeasures
- Co-design metrics with those doing the work
- Weight metrics as **inputs**, not sole performance signals
- Regularly review unintended behaviors caused by KPI pressure

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Nearly universal in scale-ups, OKR-heavy environments, and audit-obsessed orgs
