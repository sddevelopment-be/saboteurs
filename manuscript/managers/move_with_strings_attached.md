## Move the Body, Leave the Org Chart

### Sabotage Technique
Reassign someone to a new team or domain.  
But don’t update HR systems, reporting lines, or performance review ownership.

Keep all formal management, feedback loops, and career development with their old manager -- even if that person no longer sees their day-to-day work.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Say things like _“We’re just moving you temporarily — it’s still part of the same org”_
- Do not reassign line management or performance tracking
- Ensure the new team lead assumes operational control but **no formal accountability**
- At feedback or promotion time, ask the old manager to _“weigh in”_ on contributions they didn’t witness
- Bonus: forget to communicate this to either side

### Expected Symptoms
- The individual feels stranded and invisible
- Confusion about priorities, escalation paths, or goal setting
- Neither team fully _“owns”_ the person -- operationally or developmentally
- At review time, feedback is vague, outdated, or second-hand

### Amplifying Factors
- Make the move mid-cycle or without context
- Let the receiving team assume _“it’s still your old manager’s job”_
- Expect the person to bridge the gap with invisible labor
- Provide no formal mechanism to trigger reporting realignment

## Detection Clues
- _“Who’s actually your manager now?”_
- _“I haven’t had a 1:1 in months.”_
- _“My old lead says it’s up to the new team, but the new team said I’m still officially with the old one.”_
- _“No one reviewed my goals -- I think I slipped through.”_

### Countermeasures
- Treat reassignment as a **full lifecycle event**, not a project reshuffle
- Define a clear “ownership shift” protocol — HR, feedback, 1:1s, career development
- Assign **transition stewards** if formal structure takes time to catch up
- Ask explicitly: *“Who is this person accountable to, and who is accountable to them?”*

### Sabotage Credibility Rating
`High` – Extremely common in matrix orgs, dynamic resourcing environments, and informal team shifts
