## Confuse Strategy with Branding

### Sabotage Technique
Replace clear, testable strategy with aspirational language.  
Announce vague themes like *“Synergy,” “Resilience,” or “Velocity 2.0”*.  
Avoid concrete priorities. Use glossy decks. Measure buzzword compliance.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Rebrand goals into campaign slogans every 6–12 months
- Create stylized one-pagers and theme music for town halls
- Replace initiative names with metaphors: *“Horizon”, “Pulse”, “Flight Plan”*
- Never define success criteria in plain terms

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams unsure what “doing well” means
- Multiple interpretations of the same word cloud
- Work misalignment disguised by energetic branding
- People start asking: *“What are we actually doing?”*

### Amplifying Factors
- Use rotating branding vendors or internal creative teams
- Reward leaders for narrative cohesion, not outcome clarity
- Prohibit using old initiative names — even when they were clear

### Countermeasures
- Pair strategy comms with a **ruthlessly clear one-pager**
- Require that all metaphors be traceable to real work
- Use storytelling to illuminate focus — not obscure it

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

`High` – Especially common in orgs where strategy is a slideshow, not a shared map
