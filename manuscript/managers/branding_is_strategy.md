## Confuse Strategy with Branding

### Sabotage Technique
Replace clear, testable strategy with aspirational language.  
Announce vague themes like _“Synergy”_, _“Resilience”_, or _“Velocity 2.0”_.  
Avoid concrete priorities. Use glossy decks. Measure buzzword compliance.

###  Field Deployment Instructions
- Rebrand goals into campaign slogans every 6–12 months
- Create stylized one-pagers and theme music for town halls
- Replace initiative names with metaphors: _“Horizon”_, _“Pulse”_, _“Flight Plan”_
- Never define success criteria in plain terms
- Force everyone to use the new lingo in all communications

### Expected Symptoms
- Teams unsure what “doing well” means
- Multiple interpretations of the same word cloud
- Work misalignment disguised by energetic branding
- People start asking: *“What are we actually doing?”*

### Amplifying Factors

- Use rotating branding vendors or internal creative teams
- Reward leaders for **narrative cohesion, not outcome clarity**
- Prohibit using old initiative names. even when they were clear
- Assign _“brand ambassadors”_ to ensure compliance
- Ask _"How does this align with our company DNA?"_ instead of _"What does this mean for our work?"_

### Detection Clues

- _“We’re all about synergy this quarter!”_
- _"I like your presentation, but could you add in how our work supports the ‘Horizon’ initiative?”_
- _"Say, what ever happened to that ‘Velocity 2.0’ thing?”_

### Countermeasures

- Pair strategy comms with a **ruthlessly clear one-pager**
- Require that all metaphors be traceable to real work
- Use storytelling to illuminate focus — not obscure it

### Sabotage Credibility Rating

**Likelihood:** `High`  
Especially common in orgs where strategy is a slideshow, not a shared map.
