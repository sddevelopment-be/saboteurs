## Advanced Techniques

For operatives seeking to elevate their disruption game, consider these advanced techniques. Each requires a deep understanding of organizational dynamics and a flair for the theatrical.

**These are not for the faint of heart, but when executed with precision, they can leave a lasting impact.**

To ensure maximum effectiveness, these techniques should be deployed with a keen sense of timing and an understanding of the target's vulnerabilities. As always, maintain plausible deniability and avoid any actions that could lead to immediate detection or backlash.  

To get you started, here are some general guidelines and organizational attack vectors:

| Vector                      | Strategic Objective                                                           | Deployment Signals                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trust Erosion**	          | Undermine safety, cause second-guessing                                       | Teams ask _“Can I say this?”_ or _“Who told you that?”_                             |
| **Administrative Overload** | Bury in bureaucracy, kill flow                                                | _"Should we make a template for this?”_, _"What's the process?"_                    |
| **Process Worship**         | Create friction, slow down delivery                                           | _"We need a meeting to discuss this."_                                              |
| **Fragmentation**           | Divide and conquer, create silos                                              | _"Let's form a working group."_, _"Who owns this?"_, _"What are our dependencies?"_ |
| **Psychological Safety**    | Create fear of failure, discourage risk-taking                                | _"We need to be careful."_ , _"Let's not rock the boat."_                           |
| **Performance Paradox**     | Punish logic, worship dashboards. Everything is measured, nothing is aligned. | _"We need to track this."_ , _"Let's set some KPIs."_                               |
| **Tactical Overload**       | Combine patterns for recursive damage                                         | _“We’re still assembling a recurring meeting to plan on how to fix this."_          |
