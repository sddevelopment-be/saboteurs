> **Disclaimer: Satire!**  
> This repository is a satirical take on corporate culture and the concept of sabotage in a humorous context. It is not intended to promote or encourage any damaging, illegal, or unethical activities. This guide is based on the United States Office of Strategic Services' (OSS) [sabotage manual from World War II](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184), adapted for a modern corporate environment.

# Structure

The repository is structured to provide a comprehensive guide to various sabotage techniques, categorized by the role of the field agent. As corporate roles vary widely, the guide is designed to be adaptable to different contexts and situations. For maximum effectiveness, agents are encouraged to tailor the techniques to their specific environment.

## [Pattern Name]

### Sabotage Technique  
A pithy description of the core failure strategy.  
> e.g. ‚ÄúOverload all communication into one Slack channel and mute it.‚Äù

###  Field Deployment Instructions  
Exactly how to implement the sabotage in a real environment.  
Be specific and mischievous.  
> e.g. ‚ÄúCreate a Slack channel named #project-meta-updates-team-coordination. Add everyone. Pin 32 threads. Never summarize decisions.‚Äù

### Expected Symptoms  
Observable behaviors and warning signs if the sabotage is working.  
> e.g. ‚ÄúPeople stop reading messages, create side chats, and miss critical updates. Tensions rise over ‚Äòwho knew what, when.‚Äô‚Äù

### Amplifying Factors (Optional)  
How to make the failure worse or more entrenched.  
> e.g. ‚ÄúCelebrate ‚Äòquick response times‚Äô to noise. Add automated alerts to the same channel. Discourage questions.‚Äù

### Detection Clues  
Smells or phrases to listen for in the wild.  
> e.g.  
- *‚ÄúWait, that was decided?‚Äù*  
- *‚ÄúI thought someone else was on that.‚Äù*  
- *‚ÄúI missed that ‚Äî where was it posted?‚Äù*

### Countermeasures (Reality Mode)  
What thoughtful teams can do to prevent, detect, or recover.  
> e.g. ‚ÄúEstablish communication contracts. Designate signal vs. noise channels. Use short, human summaries weekly.‚Äù

### Sabotage Credibility Rating  
*(Optional: How likely is this to happen accidentally?)*  
üü° Low ‚Äì Satirical only  
`Medium` ‚Äì Sometimes happens  
`High` ‚Äì We‚Äôve lived through this and called it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù
